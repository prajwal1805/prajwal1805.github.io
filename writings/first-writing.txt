I'm an overthinker,
I  trace every path, good and bad,
Possiblilty of twist and clashes,
Until they leave me sad

I'm an overthinker,
Your every hey, becomes a maze
Pushing me to wonder, what to say,
And my mind, is lost in haze.

I'm an overthinker,
Every compliment, every troll,
I let them in, to bruise my soul,
Words like daggers, plunge in deep,
Even in dreams, I find no sleep.

I'm an overthinker,
There's one side of me, that trusts,
Tricking my mind to easily adjust,
But the other side, won't take a moment to break,
Leaving me in a hole, dying awake.

I'm an overthinker,
Each time betrayal comes my way,
A piece of me is chipped away,
Wounds run deep, turning cold and gray,
Leaving scars, that forever stay

I'm an overthinker,
It's hard to find peace for chaos inside,
Mind that screams, to the fears collide,
Yet I try to hold on a pillow tight,
Losing my courage, but still I fight.
